Currently tables are being created in following order

1. accounts
2. transactions
3. blocks
4. ballots
5. delegates
6. multisig_memberships

Note - Need proper migration order in case of addition of foreign keys or interdependency of fields across tables
       or adding or deleting columns from the table
